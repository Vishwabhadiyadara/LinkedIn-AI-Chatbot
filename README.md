# LinkedIn AI Chatbotüçá

Welcome to the LinkedIn AI Chatbot repository! This project aims to create a conversational chatbot that helps with LinkedIn recommendations based on collaboration needs, organizes databases, and assists with user acquisition.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone or Fork the Repository
To get started, first clone the repository or fork it on GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vishwabhadiyadara/LinkedIn-AI-Chatbot.git
```

### Step 2: Configure the Environment Variables
After cloning, navigate to the root directory and edit the `.env` file. You will need to add your Groq API key to this file. If you do not have a Groq API key, you can obtain one for free. For assistance, watch the video below:

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, open a terminal in the root directory of the project and run:

```sh
streamlit run main.py
```

This command will launch the Streamlit server, and the chatbot interface will open in your default web browser.
